							natural person. This will include majority of “User Generated
							Content” that you provide us with the intention of sharing with
							other users inside a transaction. Such “Non-Personal Information”
							is not covered by this privacy policy. However, as non-personal
							information may be used in aggregate or be linked with existing
							personal information; when in this form it will be treated as
							personal information. As such, this privacy policy will list both
							types of information for the sake of transparency.<br></br>
